Valencia_eBook - The school drummer's mannual:
My most recent project! For a class assignment, we had to design an ebook using existing content, in which we provide more interactivity such as hyperlinks to specific resources or knowledge checks within the book. I decided to use an old percussion book, and focused on imbeding resources and video demonstrations to make the content more applicable and approachable. I used Adobe InDesign (first time using) to create the ebook.


Valencia_How to Read HTML:
This was for assignment to make an infographic that served as a effective job aid. For this, I used Canva to create the infographic, and utilized my Information Technology skills to provide the context. The focus is a basic introduction to HTML, providing what it is, how it's used, an example, and vocabulary for foundational understanding. The design choice I am most proud of is the "Grammar" and "Basic Structure for a Webpage", for I made each element a specific color in so the "Grammar" could be used as a tool to decipher the example in the "Basic Structure for a Webpage" section.


ValenciaRichard_JobAid:
This class assignment had us make a simple job aid using a Word document. The topic of my job aid is how to play the tenor drums, focusing on what tenor drums are, how to play, and emphasizing specific techniques needed to play the instrument. The drums were created using Word's shapes function. I decided to utilize Adobe Illustrator to create vector assests for the document; I created the drummers' hands in that software.

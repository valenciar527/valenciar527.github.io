Basics to Music:
This class assignment had us follow the whole instructional design process using the ADDIE model. Prior to this, we conducted front-end analysis of the topic, audience and context, deconstructed the topic's subordinate skills and entry behavior, and created assessment and evaluation methods. This was the culumination of the semester's work. This was the first time I used Storyline 360, which I utilized the variable, triggers, and quiz pool functionality. I also created vector assets using Adobe Illustrator for the music symbols, as well as provided the voiceover.

Music Clefs:
This class assignment had us create a simple lesson using a technology of our choosing. I selected Articulate sToryline 360 to further improve my skills. For this, I decided to focus on making the development process simpler, as well as focus on better visual design and usability. I also provided the voiceover for this project as well.
